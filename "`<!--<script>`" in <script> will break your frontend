Lets say you have this string in a variable (case insensitive):
```
`etc etc etc<!-- etc etc<scRipT> etc`
```
This will break any html tag after it.

Or lets say you divided that into some variables:
```
const first = `etc etc etc <!--`;
const second = `anything`;
const third = `<script>`
```
This will also break the html page.

Therefore please carefully assign any string that contains 
``` 
`<!--<script>` 
```
or similar into a variable, if it is inside `<script>` tag.
